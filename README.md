Fault Detection Using AI (CNN-based Model)

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project aims to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for fault detection using image classification. The model classifies images into faulty and non-faulty categories based on extracted features.

The dataset used is a subset of the Caltech 101 dataset, where:

Non-faulty samples are taken from the "airplanes" category.

Faulty samples are taken from the "Faces_easy" category.

ðŸš€ Features

CNN-based classification model achieving 92% accuracy.

Signal processing techniques to enhance system optimization and reduce false positives by 20%.

Integration with digital twins (optional) for real-time fault detection.
